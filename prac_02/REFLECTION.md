# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

Approximately 70%.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch them in the afternoon or evening from home. The duration varies depending on my schedule for the day.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?


I’ve been consistent with watching lectures and try to apply the coding standards and practices discussed. I plan to continue doing this.
## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I often rely on lecture videos and instructions when I get stuck, which is helpful. However, I should be more proactive in reviewing and applying concepts independently too.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I tend to overlook some coding conventions like writing proper docstrings. I get too focused on making the code run and sometimes forget the style guidelines.
## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Even if it takes a long time, I manage to get my code working in the end. That perseverance is something I’m proud of and will continue to build on.
