# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## About This Project

This repository contains my practical work for the subject **CP1404 - Programming II** at James Cook University.  
I am learning about Python programming, clean code practices, and how to become a better software developer.

My name is **Md Naimul Islam**, and I am currently studying IT as a student.  
This repo includes all my weekly practicals from the subject and some small programs to help reinforce concepts like file handling, classes, functions, and object-oriented programming.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Here are a few key lessons I’ve learned about writing clean code so far:

- Use meaningful variable and function names so code is easier to understand.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Add comments and docstrings to explain what code is doing, especially for other people reading it.
